# FRONTEND JUNIOR REACT ASSIGNMENT
I had to a build a mockup of an ecommerce app, based on a given design and feature-requirements.

## Installation
In order to use the app, do the following: 

```
// Initializing graphql

cd ./jb-task/junior-assignment-api/
npm i         // install graphql-api necessary modules
npm run dev   // initialize graphql
npm start     // start graphql server


// Initializing App

cd ..
npm i         // install modules of this repository
npm start     
```
